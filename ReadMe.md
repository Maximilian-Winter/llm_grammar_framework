# Large Language Model Grammar Framework

This project provides a framework for grammar-guided generation using Large Language Models (LLMs). It is compatible with both llama-cpp-python and hugginface transformers.

## Overview

The LLM Grammar Framework is designed to guide the generation of text to match a specific grammar. This is achieved by biasing the logits of the LLM during generation. The framework includes a grammar parser and a logits processor for both llama-cpp-python and hugginface transformers.

## Features

- Grammar Parser: Parses the input text according to the defined grammar rules.
- Logits Processor: Biases the logits of the LLM during generation to guide the output to match the grammar.
